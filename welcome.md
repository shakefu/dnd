# Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons!

Ya'll ready to roll some dice?

## Story

Once again, we find ourselves in the [Forgotten Realms](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms), on the continent of [Faerun](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn), adventuring along the [Sword Coast](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sword_Coast).

This time you are a group of loosely knit **Monster Hunters**, earning coin by protecting small villages and defending caravans from the dangerous creatures which roam Faerun. 

Recently, it seems more aggressive and perilous creatures have been appearing more frequently in the Sword Coast, but why worry? It's only more business for you!

The world is full of powerful magic and dangerous villians, can you survive to become Legendary Heroes? Or will the Fates cut you down before your time?

## House Rules!

Because if there's no rules, how do we know when Riad is wrong?

### The ~~Ten~~ Five Commandments

1. Have fun!
2. Having fun is more important than the rules.
3. Be polite! (Talking over other people is rude.)
4. Remember it's just a game, don't get mad.
5. If you're not having fun, let's figure out how to make it fun, together!

### Characters

Any and all of the [Unearthed Arcana](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles-tags/unearthed-arcana) classes and variants are playable, as well as any Homebrew classes you find, provided you get approval first.

If anyone wants to playtest the [Channeler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saa4DpNKHvo6id1fzW3iMl-oe-ckUljCWqjVr8INS50/edit#heading=h.bll20cg20u8g) class, that's available too, though it may be subject to Nerfing.

If you're interested in an alternate race or tweaking an existing one, that can be worked out as well.

You may multiclass at will, but you must declare your next class when you are levelling up. For example, when you reach level 4, you may declare you are training a level in Fighter, and when you reach level 5, you will gain that first class level.

You may create backstories together explaining what has brought your group together, or on your own. Bonus points for depth and motivation for your character!

#### Starting Level

We are creating new characters at **Level 3**, with 1500 XP total.

You have the option of keeping an existing character from our Out of the Abyss campaign, and if you do so, you will reset your total to 2700 XP, the starting value for level 4, because undoing levels is hard.

Don't worry about being behind in XP if you choose to make a new character, by level 5 you will all be in the same bracket.

You must roll all hit dice for your hit points in front of the group, if you choose to not take the average.

#### Starting Equipment

If you are creating a new character may keep or sell your starting class equipment for full price.  You also have up to 2d4  x100 gold pieces in your personal treasure hoard, which you may spend or keep as you see fit. This must be rolled in front of the group.

If you are keeping your existing character, you may keep your equipment and valuables, and up to 1/5th of the group's gold. If there are items that were not on your character at the time we ended, you do not have them, even if they were group items.

### High Magic

We are going to play a high magic campaign, where lots of magical items and spells abound. Magical casters, potions, weapons and armor are daily occurences in the Sword Coast at this time, but that has forced the cost of purchasing them up dramatically, as well as kept the selling prices low.

The cost of purchasing magical items will be scaled with your adventuring party level as shopkeepers and traders see a good opportunity to make a quick buck. This is to ensure that the economics of the party doesn't get wildly out of hand.

You may want to consider investing in chests, saddlebags, wagons, or even houses to keep your wealth so that you don't lose it, and can accrue enough to purchase that shiny Legendary Battleax of Beerswilling you've been eyeing. Beware the thief, brigand, and pick pocket!

### Inventory

We are going to track inventory closely, as well as carrying weight and encumberance. Since this is a **High Magic** campaign, you are not allowed to to assume everything will fit in your backpack, or multiple bags of holding. :wink:

We are going to use graph paper to track inventory, where each grid square represents one pound of carry weight. When you add an item to your inventory, you must be able to find a contiguous block of squares equal to the item weight, or you cannot fit it on your person.

We will go over inventory in the first session to make sure everyone knows how to track it.

Each player will have their own inventory and gold, which is their private ownership. There will be no group loot or items.

#### Rolling for Loot

When treasure is found or recovered from a monster, all players will roll 1d6 to determine the order in which they may choose treasure. Each player chooses one item or a handful of coins to take until all the treasure is gone.

If someone gets treasure you wanted, **remember Rule #5**, and that you can negotiate, barter, trade, and buy things from each other, *in character*. And if they don't want to trade, maybe you'll get the phat loot they wanted, and can trade next time.

### Combat

We love to kill things!

Get out your rulers! The only thing we're doing differently this time is getting rid of the grid! One inch is equal to five feet. Let's have some fun with it!

Also the maps are gonna be sick.

### Inspiration

Keeping in the theme with the high magic nature of our world, we're going to try a new thing. Instead of inspiration tokens for advantage, when you roleplay well, you'll receive inspiration in the form of consumable magical trinkets, potions, or other supplies from the Gods, Hunger Games style.

These will count towards your inventory, and you may not hold more than your current level at a given time, however they cannot be sold. You may drop them if you wish to hurt the DM's feelings.

You will keep all your inspiration between sessions.


### Experience and Levelling

We're doing an XP game. So experience points will be given for successfully nagivating any encounter, for good roleplay, and for making tough in-character decisions. Navigating an encounter might mean killing all your enemies, or taking prisoners, or causing them to run away, or bartering with them to get your goal, or simply avoiding an ambush through stealth and planning. An encounter might be a tough negotiation between Kingdoms or solving riddles of a gatekeeping Wyvern.

If you fail, run away, get caught, get killed, or do the whole encounter out-of-character, you won't get much, if any experience.

If we play well and keep on task, and y'know, don't get too drunk :beer:, we should get enough experience to be leveling every three or four sessions, fairly consistently, but there are no guaranteed levels.

Try to prepare if you know you have a level coming up, so that you can level up your character quickly. You can level on a short or long rest, if you are prepared. Otherwise, if you do not know which choices you want to make, you can level at the end of the session.

### Playing

We're going to keep it flexible since we all have different schedules. But we're going to start each session with nailing down the next date. Keep them calendars updated so we can play often!

Experience! We need it. You want it. You get it when you show up. Try to show up, so you don't get too far behind and get eaten by a Dragon.

Once again, always remember **Rule #1**! Have fun!
