# Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons!

Ya'll ready to roll some dice?

## Story

Once again, we find ourselves in the [Forgotten Realms](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms), on the continent of [Faerun](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn), adventuring along the [Sword Coast](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sword_Coast).

This time you are a group of loosely knit **Monster Hunters**, earning coin by protecting small villages and defending caravans from the dangerous creatures which roam Faerun. 

Recently, it seems more aggressive and perilous creatures have been appearing more frequently in the Sword Coast, but why worry? It's only more business for you!

The world is full of powerful magic and dangerous villians, can you survive to become Legendary Heroes? Or will the Fates cut you down before your time?

## House Rules!

Because if there's no rules, how do we know when Riad is wrong?

### The ~~Ten~~ Five Commandments

1. Have fun!
2. Having fun is more important than the rules.
4. Be polite! Talking over other people is rude.
5. Remember it's just a game, don't get mad.
3. If you're not having fun, let's figure out how to make it fun, together!

### Characters

Any and all of the [Unearthed Arcana](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles-tags/unearthed-arcana) classes and variants are playable, as well as any Homebrew classes you find, provided you get approval first.

If anyone wants to playtest the [Channeler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saa4DpNKHvo6id1fzW3iMl-oe-ckUljCWqjVr8INS50/edit#heading=h.bll20cg20u8g) class, that's available too, though it may be subject to Nerfing.

If you're interested in an alternate race or tweaking an existing one, that can be worked out as well.

You may multiclass at will, but you must declare your next class when you are levelling up. For example, when you reach level 4, you may declare you are training a level in Fighter, and when you reach level 5, you will gain that first class level.

##### Starting Level

We are creating new Characters at level 3. You have the option of keeping an existing character from our Out of the Abyss campaign, and if you do so, you will reset your total XP to 2700, the starting value for level 4.

You must roll all hit dice in front of the group, if you do not take the average.

##### Starting Equipment

If you are keeping your existing character, you may keep your equipment and valuables, and up to 1/5th of the group's gold. If there are items that were not on your character at the time we ended, you do not have them, even if they were group items.

If you are creating a new character may keep or sell your starting class equipment for full price.  You also have up to 2d4  x100 gold pieces in your personal treasure hoard, which you may spend or keep as you see fit. This must be rolled in front of the group.
